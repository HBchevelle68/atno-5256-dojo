The Linux command line interface is actually a sophisticated programming language with which you can write actual programs!
Because the command line interface is colloquially referred to as a "shell", programs written in this language are referred to as "shell scripts".
When you're using the command line, you are basically writing a shell script line by line!

Like most programming languages, the shell supports variables.
This module will get you familiar with setting, printing, and using these variables!
